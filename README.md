# Armor Rush Translations

### [In Progress: v3.215]

Repository for easy-access and management of the English language files for the Red Alert 3 mod named "Armor Rush".
I made this repository with the intent of having easy management for this project since a handful of us work on the same files.

This will make it easier for all of us to cross-compare our translations and to have both a central and secure place to store everything, negating the possibility of data loss on either of our ends for whatever reasons come to pass.

If you want to play Armor Rush yourself, you can download the mod <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/red-alert-armor-rush/downloads">here</a> on ModDB.

## PoEdit Files
The files within this folder are the raw translation files that one can edit using "Poedit". The current translation files are located in a folder by itself with a date range as its directory name.
The .zip files within the _Archived folder are strictly for archival purposes and are based on older translation versions. Do not touch these files as they serve as both a reference and as version control for the repository.

## Tools
Some neat translation tools are included within this folder--one of them being Poedit.
